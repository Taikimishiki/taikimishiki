# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tanimishiki or Tani for short

I'm a self-taught programmer with 9 years of experience.
My first programming language was Lua, and it was thanks to Roblox that I discovered programming.
After many years, I learned more languages such as JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C/C++, and more. However, I found a suitable programming language for myself, which is C#, and it is currently my main programming language.

## ðŸ‘Ž Dislikes
- I hate working with low programming languages except Rust.
- I don't really like dynamically-typed programming languages because we can't guarantee the type-safety.
