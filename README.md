<h1 align="center">ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Tanimishiki or Tani for short</h1>

I'm a self-taught programmer with 7 years of experience.
My first programming language was Lua, and it was thanks to Roblox that I discovered programming.
After many years, I have learned several languages such as JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C/C++, and more. However, I found a suitable programming language for myself, which is C#, and it has been my main programming language for the past 4 years.
